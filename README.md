# Snowstorm Integration with General Music Applications

- I want to read from Mpris.MediaPlayer2
- Serialise it into a Metadata object
- Compare it to known metadata sources
- Display the lyrics in terminal
- Display the lyrics in an overlay

I will want to store the Metadata in a database, in a consistent location for persistence, and control which directories are scanned.
